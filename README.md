Sample edit for hashicorp interview
I think there are unknowns as far as HashiCorp's style--capitalization of the section titles is unclear, whether editors should return incomplete material to the writer or write it themselves (I chose to write it and ask for revisions, based on my usual engineer-hates-to-write practice), spacing after punctuation, American vs British English (I see examples of both on the website), and so on. I added third-level subtitles because I like it granualar, even though the template used third level titles for CLI, web, and API. Which begs the question--should we be presenting how to use Terraform Cloud here, or elsewhere?
